# üî• Roast Me ‚Äì AI-Powered Instagram Roast Generator

**Role:** Fullstack Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Typescript, Apify API, Gemini 2.5 AI

## Overview  
Roast Me is a fun and interactive web application where users can generate AI-powered "roasts" based on public Instagram profile data.

It‚Äôs a creative project that blends AI, automation, and humor into a seamless experience.

## Key Features

- **AI Roast Generation:** Connects to Gemini 2.5 to produce personalized, humorous roasts.
- **Built with Next.js:** Combines frontend and backend logic using Next.js' built-in API routes.
- **Stateless Architecture:** No database used‚Äîdata is processed on-the-fly through API integration.
- **Modern UI:** Built with React under the Next.js framework for smooth, responsive performance.

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates my ability to build fullstack applications using Next.js, work with third-party APIs, and creatively implement AI services to build engaging web tools.
